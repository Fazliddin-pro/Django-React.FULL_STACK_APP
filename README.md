# NotesApp - My First Full-Stack Project with Django & React üöÄ

This is my first full-stack web application built using **Django REST Framework (DRF)** and **React**. The project allows users to register, authenticate, and manage personal notes with full CRUD functionality.

## üåü Project Highlights:
- Implemented a **RESTful API** using Django REST Framework.
- Built a **React frontend** for an interactive user experience.
- Integrated **JWT authentication** for secure user login and access control.
- Utilized **PostgreSQL** as the database for storing user data and notes.
- Enabled full **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for managing notes.
- Designed a clean and responsive UI using modern frontend libraries.
- Implemented **real-time updates** with React state management.
- Used **pagination** to efficiently handle large lists of notes.
- Included **search functionality** for quick note retrieval.
- Implemented **auto-logout** when the JWT token expires for enhanced security.

## üîê How It Works:
- Users can **register and log in** using a username and password.
- Upon login, the system generates **JWT tokens** for authentication.
- Users can create **notes** with a title and content.
- Each note can be **edited or deleted** by its owner.
- The frontend interacts with the backend via **protected API endpoints**.
- All requests require an **access token** for security.
- Users are automatically logged out when their session expires.
- Notes can be **searched** by title for easy access.
- Large lists of notes are efficiently handled with **pagination**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used:
- **Django & Django REST Framework** for the backend.
- **React & React Router** for the frontend.
- **PostgreSQL** for data persistence.
- **JWT authentication** for user security.
- **Axios** for handling API requests.
- **React Context API** for global state management.

This project is a work in progreSQL, and I plan to enhance it with new features over time! üöÄ
