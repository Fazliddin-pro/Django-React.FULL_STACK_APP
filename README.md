# NotesApp - My First Full-Stack Project with Django & React 🚀

This is my first full-stack web application built using **Django REST Framework (DRF)** and **React**. The project allows users to create, edit, and manage notes securely with JWT authentication.

## 🌟 Project Highlights:
- Implemented a **RESTful API** using Django REST Framework.
- Built a **React frontend** for a seamless user experience.
- Integrated **JWT authentication** for secure login and access.
- Utilized **PostgreSQL** as the database for storing notes.
- Enabled full **CRUD operations** for managing notes.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used:
- **Django & Django REST Framework** for the backend.
- **React & React Router** for the frontend.
- **PostgreSQL** for data persistence.
- **JWT authentication** for user security.

This project is a work in progress, and I plan to enhance it with new features over time! 🚀
